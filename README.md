# The App

This app is built with reactjs and uses json server as "fake" database where the tasks are stored. The app focuses on the functionality and was my first project with reactjs.

## Features
  - Add new task
  - Delete unwanted ones
  - Modify task descriptions and tags
  - Arrange tasks
  - Mark tasks as done
  - Archive where you can view tasks marked as done
